# Hello-World
My Intro to Github
Hello

Alan here, totally new to programing, Arduino, IoT dev, etc.  I have a BS in Agriculture, an MBA, and almost 20 years of experience in the telecom sector, all of that time in various functions in operations; we are currently going through a phase of resource optimization (AI, IoT, Machine Learning, Automation, RPA, etc).  I am currently looking at how I can expand my hobby(ies) of gardening/greenhouses and woodworking, with automation, machine learning, etc., and set myself up for life when i retire (currently 43, looking at 1-2 years remaining).  I'm here to investigate, learn, and be mentored.
